Test Task for Front-End Developer Role
Objective
Create a simplified version of a feature for a React TypeScript application, 
focusing on integrating basic UI components and functionality. 
This task is designed to assess your skills in React, and TypeScript, 
and your ability to translate design concepts into functional application components.

Task Description
You are to develop a mini-application or a specific feature within an existing
 application framework. The feature should include the following elements:
Radio Selection Buttons

Implement a set of radio buttons that allow the user to select between three options
 (e.g., "Option A", "Option B", "Option C").
Selected option should be stored in the application's state.

Text Box for Discount Code Entry
Create a text box where users can enter a discount code.
Include basic validation to check if the entered text follows a simple pattern (e.g., "DISCOUNT2024").
Button to Simulate Discount Code Generation
Implement a button that, when clicked, generates a mock discount code (e.g., "NEWCODE123") and displays it to the user.
The generated code doesn't need to be stored.
Basic Note Field
Add a text box where users can enter notes or comments.
Ensure the text entered is accessible in the application's state.


Requirements

Use React for UI development and Redux for state management.
Style the components using Tailwind for a polished look.
Ensure the application is responsive and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Write clean, maintainable code, with comments where necessary to explain complex logic
Evaluation Criteria
Adherence to the task requirements and completion of the outlined features.
Code quality, including readability, structure, and use of best practices.
Visual appeal and usability of the UI components.
Effective use of React, and Tailwind.
Submission Guidelines
Host your code on GitHub and provide a link to the repository.
Ensure the README file includes instructions on how to set up and run your application.
Document any assumptions or decisions you made during the development process.

Time Allocation
You have 2-3 hours to complete this task. 
Please submit your work by the end of the allotted time, even if all 
components are not fully polished. We are interested in seeing your approach 
and prioritization within the given time frame.
